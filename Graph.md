## Graph

 **Degree of a vertex**

> The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to that vertex.
>
> For directed graph
>
> 1. the in-degree of a vertex *v* is the number of edges that have *v* as the head
> 2. the out-degree of a vertex *v* is the number of edges that have *v* as the tail

**Path**

> sequence of vertices v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,...v<sub>k</sub> such that consecutive vertices v<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>i+1</sub> are adjacent. 

**Simple Path**

> no repeated vertices

**Cycle**

> simple path, except that the last vertex is the same as the first vertex

**Connected Graph**

> any two vertices are connected by some path

**Subgraph**

> subset of vertices and edges forming a graph

**Connected Component**

> a maximal subset of a topological space that cannot be covered by the union of two disjoint open sets

**Complete Graph**

> one in which all pairs of vertices are adjacent
